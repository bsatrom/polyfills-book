== Building Your First Polyfill, Part 3 - Performance and Edge-Case Testing

Over the last two chapters, we've built a pretty nice cross-browser polyfill from the ground up, and we've even added a complete testing setup to ensure that your library always works, as expected. So while Chapters 3 and 4 were about making sure that your polyfill works, this chapter is about making sure that it works well. In particular, we're going to discuss optimizing your polyfill for performance, as well as how to handle quirky, browser-specific edge cases that can reveal themselves from time-to-time.

=== Building for Performance

In Chapter 2, I introduced several principles of "responsible polyfill" development. One of these was "Build with performance in mind." The spirit of this principle is to encourage polyfill developers to go beyond only delivering a functional equivalent to a native browser feature via their library, but to ensure that this equivalent is also as fast as it possibly can be. 

This is a high bar, for sure. Your polyfill's performance baseline is the native rendering capabilities of the browser. Chances are, your library won't be able to match the speed of a native feature, and attempting to do so should not be your focus. Rather than worrying about a native performance baseline, you should instead strive to pass the front-end developers' _noticeability_ test. It's a simple test. If, after including your library in his or her application, a developer's app runs noticeably slower, you can expect that your polyfill will be dropped on the floor, quickly. That, or the developer will contact you and complain. Remember, polyfills are designed to emulate native browser capabilities, so you should consider it your solemn duty *not* to be noticed by developers, or end-users, for that matter. And while the _noticeability_ test itself is both far from scientific and something that varies from developer to developer, there are some strategies you can adopt to increase the chances that you'll pass this test:

. Set-up Performance Benchmarks
. Don't Execute Code Too Early or Too Often
. Iterate Until You're Happy, and Then Iterate Some More

We'll look at each of these, in turn, in this section.

==== Setting Up Performance Benchmarks

First-things-first, if you want to build for performance, you need to be able to test and asses the performance of your polyfill. You certainly *could* eyeball it and judge your library by how fast it "feels" to you, but I suggest being a bit more scientific, if you can stand it. Specifically, I suggest using http://jsperf.com[JSPerf] to benchmark and test your polyfill, not only at the start, but as you continue to iterate and make changes. JSPerf, which is based on the open-source http://benchmarkjs.com[Benchmark.js] library, is a quick and easy way to set-up tests of your library's features and functionality. Alternatively, you *could* use Benchmark.js directly, the https://github.com/shama/grunt-benchmark[grunt-benchmark] Grunt plugin, or just use the DevTools in your favorite browser to run ad-hoc tests, but I find that JSPerf has everything I need to perform performance tests across revisions to my polyfills. Plus, it has pretty charts, courtesy of http://browserscope.org[Browserscope]. In the next section, I'll walk through setting up a simple JSPerf test to show the delta after a simple tweak to my polyfill.

==== Don't Execute Code Too Early or Too Often

The next strategy we can employ to pass the _noticiability_ test is to make sure that our polyfill doesn't execute any code it doesn't have to. This is especially important if your library is a drop-in or opt-in polyfill that performs it's own feature detection. For instance, our HTML5 Forms Polyfill needs to test for browser support of several input types. In Chapter 3, we perform feature detection as we loop over each input in a form, as shown in <<EX5-1>>.

===== The First Perf Tweak: Caching Feature Tests

This approach works, but perhaps you noticed that we perform the feature detection test--creating an in-memory input element and setting it's type--each and every time. So, if I have twenty inputs on my form with the new "color" type, I'll perform this dance twenty times. This is unnecessary. The user's browser won't change in the middle of a page load, so there's really no reason for me to perform these feature tests each time through. Instead, it makes more sense to test each feature when my library loads, and cache the result of each test as a boolean that I can access later. <<EX5-2>> shows an example of this for my HTML5 Forms polyfill.

  ui.plugin(Form);

<1> Test and cache each feature during the script load
<2> Access the cached test value during the "upgrade" process
====

In <<EX5-2>>, I moved the +isFormTypeSupported+ function outside of my widget initialization code, and created a local +featureDetects+ object to hold the cached, boolean values for each test. Finally, in my main initialization loop, I access those cached values, and bypass repeated code paths. 

This is nice in theory, and it certainly looks a bit cleaner, but just how fast is it? To answer that question, I can head over to http://jsperf.com[JSPerf] and create a test. 

JSPerf can seem a bit daunting if you've only every viewed others' tests before, but it's actually quite simple to create tests of your own. The basic idea behind JSPerf is to create multiple test cases that execute blocks of JavaScript code--performing operations, mutating the DOM, etc.--which the tool then executes over and over again in order to determine which operations are fastest and slowest. JSPerf takes care of all of the looping and re-runs, so all you need to do is specify the test cases, and any set-up or teardown that should happen before or after each test run.

In order to test just how much feature test caching improves the performance of our code, I created the test shown in <<EX5-3>>. You can also http://jsperf.com/feature-test-cache[access the test online], and run it yourself, if you so desire.

[[EX5-3]]
.JSPerf Test for Feature Test Caching
image::images/ch5-ex3.png[]

The "Preparation Code" section in <<EX5-3>> shows the setup and teardown code that will run before each test. This code does not impact the timing of the tests. Here, I create a global feature test method, +isFormTypeSupported+, as well as a global +featureDetects+ object, similar to <<EX5-2>>. 

The "Test Runner" section contains my actual tests. The "Test Each Time" block does exactly what it says, each time that block is called, it will call the +isTypeSupported+ method. This block mimics my original functionality in <<EX5-1>>. The "Cache Tests" block, on the other hand, simply accesses the cached feature test values. If I run these tests a few times, I'll get a result similar to <<EX5-4>>.

[[EX5-4]]
.JSPerf Test Results for Feature Test Caching
image::images/ch5-ex4.png[]

As you can see from the image above, caching my feature tests is not only faster, it's nearly 60 times faster than performing feature tests each time! Of course, it's important to note that, since JSPerf runs each test case several dozen times over, reported numbers aren't indicative of raw, overall performance gains in my library. Rather, JSPerf is most valuable as a measure of relative performance between options. The bottom line, in this case, is that we know that caching feature tests is faster and, thus, an excellent refactoring choice for my library.

So far, in this section, we've avoided executing unnecessary code by ensuring that feature detection tests only run once when my library is loaded. This is a specific example of a general case and beyond changes like this, another optimization I can perform is to ensure that my library doesn't perform any unnecessary initialization or set-up. Any features or functionality that my library might not need for all browsers should remain dormant until it's needed. Obviously, stylesheets and JavaScript will need to be parsed when they are included, but I want try to execute as little of that code as possible, until my library is called upon. In the case of my polyfill, the only code that runs before I initialize a Form widget is my now cached feature tests, which I've deemed necessary to run up-front since the performance gains are considerable.

==== Iterate Until You're Happy, Then Iterate Some More

The final strategy to keep your library performing well under the watchful eyes of consuming devs is to iterate, test and iterate again. In essence, this is a bit of a hunt and peck exercise, where I'll look for micro- and macro-optimizations in my library, make changes and then test those against the last version, using JSPerf, of course. Some changes will make no difference in the performance of my library, while others will make a noticeable difference. Some might even harm performance, innocent as they may seem.

There's no science to this process, unfortunately, so I can't give you a bunch of tried and true tweaks that can be made to every library under the sun. I can, however, show you a couple of tweaks I made to my HTML5 Forms Polyfill to give you an idea of what minor and major improvements might look like. Beyond these, your best bet is to pay attention to JavaScript "best practices," as well as the proven practices of the libraries or frameworks you're utilizing. "Best practices" are often named as such because they promote maintenance, readability of code and good performance, so you'll benefit from these even if they don't show considerable gains in your performance tests.

Before we proceed with the next few performance tweaks, I want to share the code samples for the "complete" HTML5 Forms polyfill. Thus far, I've only included snippets for three new input types. However, to properly show the impact of the next couple of refactors, we need to look at the complete source. In the production version of my polyfill, the source is broken into three modules, or files, that I concatenate during my build process. Those files are:

. +kendo.forms.types.js+ - Contains all of the input types supported by my polyfill, and the logic used to "upgrade" each to use a Kendo UI widget. The full source of this file can be viewed in <<EX5-5>>.
. +kendo.forms.features.js+ - Feature detection tests for my polyfill. The full source of this file can be viewed in <<EX5-6>>.
. +kendo.forms.js+ - The main source file for my polyfill. Contains widget initialization code and depends on +kendo.forms.types.js+ and +kendo.forms.features.js+. The full source of this file can be viewed in <<EX5-7>>.

As we go go through the next three performance tweaks, we'll make minor and major changes to the source above. Once we're done with all three, I'll create another JSPerf test to compare each change so that we can measure the relative impact to performance. Let's take a look first at an easy change.

===== The Second Perf Tweak: Caching DOM Elements

As you probably know, accessing and mutating the DOM is one of the most expensive operations you can make from JavaScript. Whether you're using a library like jQuery or a raw DOM selector method like +getElementById+ or +querySelector+, selecting elements from your page is a memory-hogging thread-blocking process that you want to perform with caution. This is not to say, of course, that you should _avoid_ interacting with the DOM, because that would be silly. Rather, you should keep this reality in mind as you build your polyfills and do your best to minimize DOM interactions, as much as possible. 

While there are many ways to minimize DOM interactions in our JavaScript apps and polyfills, the two most common "best practices" are:

. Minimize DOM "reads" by caching the result of selection operations into local variables.
. Minimize DOM "writes" by batching mutation operations together.

As, an example of the the batching approach, let's assume that I'm iterating over some collection of values in JavaScript and building up a HTML list (+<ul>+ or +<li>+). Instead of appending each row (+<li>+) to my list, one at a time, a batching approach would lead me to build up the entire list in a string or DOM +DocumentFragment+ and append the entire collection to the list container a single time. With this approach, I'm mutating the DOM--and triggering the browser's expensive layout, paint and render operations--a single time, instead of once for each list item.

Chances are, if you've been doing front-end work for a while, this approach isn't news to you. We know that DOM writes are slow, and we take necessary precautions to avoid them. DOM reads, on the other hand, are a bit less worrisome, but still worth minimizing. As such, we address these by creating local variables for the result of DOM reads and operate on these variables when we need to access page elements. 

An example of this element caching approach with jQuery can be seen in <<EX5-7>>. On line 10, you'll see the following line:

+var form = $(element);+

In this case, +element+ represents the +<form>+ that I'm calling the Kendo UI Widget constructor on (+new kendoForm()+). The jQuery method gives me the +<form>+ element, which I then assign to the +form+ variable. 

Further down the sample, you'll notice that I then access this variable three additional times, each time calling +form.find+ to further refine the list. In this case, even though the form itself is cached, jQuery has to return to the DOM to give me the collection of elements that match my +find+ selector. Since all of my +find+ operations are meant to operate on HTML input elements, I can make my cached variable a bit more targeted, which I've done in <<EX5-8>>:

<1> Cache the collection of +<input>+ and +<button>+ elements in my form
<2> Use jQuery's +filter+ method to get only the inputs that match the current type
<3> No need to filter here since the full collection is already cached.
====

Instead of caching the entire form in a local variable, I cache all of the +<input>+ and +<button>+ elements, since those are the only parts of the form I'm interested in, at this point. With that new collection in hand, I'll use jQuery's +filter+ method to refine the collection when I'm operating on a smaller subset. It's a small change, but it cleans up the DOM reads for my polyfill and makes things a bit more readable, to boot. Now, before we test the performance impact of this change, let's make a few more tweaks so that we can view everything side-by-side at once.

===== The Third Perf Tweak: Ordering of Arguments

The next change I'm going to make is a very small one, but it harkens back to the idea of avoiding unnecessary code paths as a way to get micro-optimizations in our code. Many times, these unneeded paths can be found in if statements that asses one or more values before taking action. For example, in <<EX5-7>>, you'll notice the following +if+ statement on line 17:

+if (!kendo.forms.features[modType] || that.options.alwaysUseWidgets)+

This statement determines if the current input type (i.e. 'number') is supported by the user's browser _or_ if the developer passed the +alwaysUseWidgets+ option into the widget constructor. If either is true, we upgrade all instances of that input type on the form.

When dealing with multi-conditioned +if+ statements, it's always a good idea to consider how the order of arguments affects code execution. For instance, since the feature tests appear first, these will always be evaluated. If, however, I re-order these arguments, I can ensure that my feature test object will only be accessed if +alwaysUseWidgets+ is +false+:

+if (that.options.alwaysUseWidgets || !kendo.forms.features[modType])+

Had I not already refactored my feature tests to run once during script evaluation, this would likely be a noticeable performance gain. As it stands now, each feature is returning a simple boolean so I don't expect to see much difference. Even still, I'm making this change to "future proof" my polyfill a bit. The +alwaysUseWidgets+ option will always be a simple boolean, but my feature tests could grow and become more complex as my library matures. Making this change now will keep me from introducing unintended performance costs down the road.

While the example above is a simple case for ordering arguments, It's always a good idea to order your simple booleans first in your +if+ statements. When performing an or (+||+) evaluation, this will ensure that the right-hand arguments aren't assessed unless the simple boolean is false. When performing an and (+&&+) evaluation, right-hand arguments aren't assessed unless the simple boolean is true. In both cases, your more complex method-call booleans won't be evaluated unless their values are needed to fulfill or reject the condition in question.

===== The Fourth Perf Tweak: Minimizing Loops

The final performance change I plan to make to my polyfill is a larger one, and is also a change that I expect to impact performance quite a bit. If you take a look at <<EX5-7>> a final time, you'll notice that I'm looping (+for+ or jQuery's +each+) no less than four times during widget initialization. This can't be the best approach, so I'm going to refactor my polyfill to loop as as infrequently as possible. 

In <<EX5-7>> I'm looping over the +typeUpgrades+ collection defined in +kendo.forms.types+, and then separately looping over each input that matches that type. What's more, I'm looping over each input to determine if it needs separate widget styling (provided via CSS classes that Kendo UI uses to style "vanilla" inputs) and finally, looping over each element that contains a +placeholder+ attribute and upgrading those as well, if not supported by the browser.

As we built up our polyfill in Chapter 3, each of these additions made sense, and they do fulfill the functional requirements of my library. And yet, it all seems so inefficient. This inefficiency was likely introduced as a result of my initial decision to loop first over input types and second over elements. At the time, this made sense because it allowed me to simultaneously upgrade all of the "color," "number" or "datetime" inputs on the form using jQuery's +each+ method. But as I add other features, it becomes clear that my library will need to operate on each input individually, upgrading its type, dealing with placeholder support and even adding validation once I expand my library with that functionality.

So, to shift from several loops to a single loop, I need to move a few things around. For starers, my +kendo.forms.types+ object needs to change. As illustrated in <<EX5-9>>, I've changed the object from an array of type objects, to a single object of key-value pairs. This will make it much easier for me to work with each type. You'll also notice that I moved some of the "upgrade" logic for vanilla inputs and buttons out of my main file and into this object, as well.

I think you'll agree that this is much cleaner, but is it any faster? For that matter, have any of these changes made a difference? Let's take a look in the next section.

==== Running Performance Benchmarks

One of the nice things about JSPerf is that, with a little bit of setup, it's easy to do side-by-side testing of revisions. In the case of our last three tweaks, I created a new JSPerf test, which you can http://jsperf.com/kendo-ui-forms-performance/5[view online], if you so desire. You can also append +/edit+ to the end of the url if you want to see how the test was set-up, or make edits of your own. 

For this test, I included the same sample Form that we created in Chapter 3, and used JSPerf's set-up capability to load a different version of my polyfill source, depending on the individual test case. All-in-all, I created four tests:

. A baseline Test, before any changes were made
. A test for the Element Caching refactor
. A test of the argument ordering refactor
. A test for the single loop refactor.

The results can be seen in <<EX5-11>>. The results for an individual run can be seen in the top part of the image, with summary results for all browsers at the bottom. 

[[EX5-11]]
.JSPerf test for tweaks 2-4
image::images/ch5-ex11.png[]

There are a couple of things to take away from the image above:

. Individual test runs can give different results, so be sure to run your tests several times, and in as many browsers as possible. In the image above, my element cache refactor looks like the slowest test, though it's still well within the standard deviation (+/-) of 4.96% indicated by JSPerf. If you look at the bar charts at the bottom of the image, you'll note that, over a larger sample size, the element cache refactor (in yellow) is faster than my baseline test (in red) in most browsers.
. For most browsers, the argument reordering change isn't much faster than the element cache refactor. I expected this, so as long as it's not noticeably _slower_, it's a worthwhile change. It does seem to be visibly faster in the current version (at the time of writing) of Chrome, however, so I'll take it.
. Finally, as expected, the single loop refactor yielded the largest gains across most browsers, especially Chrome. It's faster in Opera and Safari, as well and, even though you can't see it due to scale, was faster in my IE 8 tests. Surprisingly, these changes are all about even on Firefox but, again, since performance isn't markedly worse, I'm okay with an outlier or two.

==== Tune It, But Don't Overdo It

As I mentioned above, there's not really much science involved in making performance tweaks to your polyfill. It's more an exercise of trial and error with the goal of finding micro- and macro-optimizations that make your library faster. In the examples above, I made some small and large changes based on my knowledge of good JavaScript practices, and it turned out that those changes yielded some gains in most browsers.

Before I close this section, a word of caution: performance tuning is important, and it's something you should spend time on, but I suggest being careful with it. It's easy to make common-sense changes that you might have missed in initial development, but once you've made a handful of obvious or even non-obvious tweaks, diminishing returns will start to set in, and you'll be spending far too much time making changes to eke out an extra tenth of a percent speed improvement. When it starts to feel like each change isn't moving the performance needle enough, or even moving it in the wrong direction, it's time feel confident that you've done your best, and move on.

=== Dealing with Browser-Specific Edge-Cases

Now that we've talked about general performance testing, I'll close this chapter with a brief discussion on browser-specific edge-cases. As I mentioned at the end of Chapter 4, regardless of your build and automated testing workflow, there's no substitute for hands-on actual testing with certain browsers, especially oldIE. While it's still important to test IE 7 and 8 for most kinds of sites and apps, it's critically important when you are building polyfills. More often than not, IE 7 and 8 will need the functionality your polyfill provides, so you'll want to test on these browsers early and often.

After making each of the performance tweaks listed in this chapter, I was sure to run all of my automated tests with the +grunt test+ and +grunt x-test+ commands I set up in Chapter 4. Everything looks great in the latest browsers, but when I open up a VM with IE 8 or IE 7, I see something that looks more like <<EX5-12>>.

[[EX5-12]]
.Testing my polyfill with IE 8
image::images/ch5-ex12.png[] 

In spite of all of my testing, I still have a handful of failing tests in IE 7 and 8. Digging deeper, however, I see that they're all Date- and Time-related tests, which suggests a common cause for all of these. Let's take a look at the first failing test, which is listed in <<EX5-13>>:

[[EX5-13]]
.Datetime Jasmine test block

describe('DateTime and datetime-local type Support', function() {
  it('should apply the datetime attributes (val, min, max, step) to the widget', function() {
    fixtures.load('datetime-type.html');

    $('#datetime-form').kendoForm();

    var datetimeInput = $('#datetime');
    var datetimeObject = datetimeInput.data('kendoDateTimePicker');

    var dateRegex = /\/|-| /g;
    var valParts = datetimeInput.val().split(dateRegex);
    var minParts = datetimeInput.attr('min').split(dateRegex);
    var maxParts = datetimeInput.attr('max').split(dateRegex);

    expect(datetimeObject.value()).not.toBeNull();
    expect(datetimeObject.value().getMonth()+1).toEqual(
      parseInt(valParts[0], 10)); <1>
    expect(datetimeObject.value().getDate()).toEqual(
      parseInt(valParts[1], 10));
					
    expect(datetimeObject.value().getFullYear()).toEqual(
      parseInt(valParts[2], 10));

    // Run Same tests for min and max date values
    // ...
  });
}

<1> This test fails here in IE 7 and 8
====

This test, which I've clipped for readability, is designed to make sure that the Kendo UI DateTime widget is properly initialized with the date input's +value+ attribute. ON IE 7 and 8, this test fails at the second +expect+. Upon further investigation, it appears that the +dateTimeObject+ variable is null because my DateTime widget wasn't properly initialized. That means that the problem is in my "upgrade" function, which I've included in <<EX5-14>>, below.

.DateTime upgrade logic

var typeUpgrades = {
  datetime: function (val) {
    var input = $(val);

    // Step attribute is seconds, interval in minute
    var defaults = getDateTimeDefaults(input);
    defaults.interval = input.attr('step') ?
      Math.round(parseInt(input.attr('step'), 10)/60) : 30;
    input.kendoDateTimePicker(defaults);
  }
  /* Other upgrades */
};

function getDateTimeDefaults(input) {
  return {
    value: input.val().length > 0 ? new Date(input.val()) : null,
    min: input.attr('min') ? new Date(input.attr('min'))
      : new Date(1900, 0, 1),
    max: input.attr('max') ? new Date(input.attr('max'))
      : new Date(2099, 11, 31)
  };
}

kendo.forms.types = typeUpgrades;
----
====

The issue, it would seem, is with the +getDateTimeDefaults+ helper function, which takes my input and returns an object with date values that I then pass to the Kendo UI +kendoDateTimePicker+ method. If you look closely, you'll notice  that I'm not properly sanitizing my attribute values to make sure that they contain a valid date. Instead, I'm merely checking for the presence of any value before calling the +new Date()+ constructor on that value. Even still, these are my own unit tests, and I'm only passing perfectly valid ISO date strings, as per the forms section of the HTML5 spec, so why in the world are my tests failing?  

The answer is deceptively simple: IE 7 and 8 don't support the ISO Date standard when parsing date strings. Welcome to the world of cross-browser polyfill development, my friends! Thankfully, it's a relatively simple fix. If I wanted to take an external dependency, I could include a library like http://moment.js[Moment.js] to handle the hassle of date parsing. I can also leverage built-in features of Kendo UI or jQuery to help. For the sake of completeness, however, in this case, I'm going to add my own fix. First, I'll add a new +creteDateFromInput+ method to the +kendo.forms.types.js+ file, as shown in <<EX5-15>>:

[[EX5-15]]
.Handling ISO and non-ISO date formats for oldIE
====
[source, js]
----
function createDateFromInput(val, defaultDate, prefix) {
  if (!val) {
    return defaultDate;
  }

  if (prefix) {
    val = prefix + val;
  }

  if (!Date.parse(val)) {
    // Valid ISO Dates may not parse on some browsers (IE7,8)
    var altDate = new Date(val.replace(/-/g, '/'));

    if (altDate) {
      // If this alternate value is valid, add a day
      // to account for UA parsing
      return new Date(altDate.setDate(altDate.getDate() + 1));
    }

    return defaultDate;
  }

  return new Date(val);
}
----
====

This simplistic solution takes a string value, a defaultDate and an optional prefix value, which I'll need to parse the HTML5 time and month input types. If the passed-in value parses correctly, I'll return a new Date object with that value. If not, I'll replace the dashes (+-+) with slashes (+/+) and attempt to parse again, which should resolve my issues in IE 7 and 8.

Next, I can modify my +getDateTimeDefaults+ function to use this  new function:

[source, js]
----
function getDateTimeDefaults(input) {
  return {
    value: createDateFromInput(input.val(), null),
    min: createDateFromInput(input.attr('min'), new Date(1900, 0, 1)),
    max: createDateFromInput(input.attr('max'), new Date(2099, 11, 31))
  };
}
----

With this in place, my datetime and datetime-local tests should pass. The remaining failing tests relate to similar problems with the time and month input types, and as soon as I modify those upgrade functions to use my new helper method, I should see all green in IE 7 and 8, as shown in <<EX5-16>>.

Much like performance testing, cross-browser issues are hard to generalize. Each browser has their own quirks and edge cases that behave differently from all the rest. IE 7 and 8 certainly aren't alone in this regard. Modern specs have done a great job of minimizing these types of differences in newer browsers, but you should expect to encounter hairy issues from time to time as you build cross-browser polyfills. Thankfully, these quirks, and their workarounds are often well-documented, so you shouldn't need to go far to find a fix.

Over the last three chapters, we've discussed many of the ins and outs of building your own cross-browser polyfills, from getting started, to configuring a solid build and test environment and finally, to performance and edge-case tuning. Collectively, you should have a solid foundation to use for building your own polyfills, and I can't wait to see what you'll come up with!

Next, we'll turn the discussion to future polyfilling, or the practice of adding new APIs and functionality to our browsers, for the purpose of vetting and testing out what's next for the web platform.

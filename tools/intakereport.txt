Resources
=========

** Intake PDFs: 
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake.pdf
   (Git repo) pdf/drafts/intake_with_remarks.pdf

** Figs: Illustrations is still working on the figs. 
   24 total. (0 are informal; 0 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** Syntax highlighting: applied to 98 out of 98 code listings.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.

** When you create a pdf you'll see the following error:

Request for title of element with no title: blockquote (id="EX2-1")
Request for title of element with no title: blockquote (id="EX2-1")

The author tries to use an xref to reference several blocks of text and lists styled as a quote. That won't work, so it would probably be best to work with the author for an alternative solution or to delete the xref altogether.

Notes from Dan:
==================

Ready for intake.

Author name is missing from title page.

[Fixed. --Tools]

Foreword will be coming later.

Print needed at Fluent, so FTP should be 2/14 (ideally). Could stretch to 2/20, but better to make 2/14.

*Hard-coded xrefs to chapters! Booooooo.

[Fixed. --Tools]

Spend a little time breaking chapter headings. Some look pretty bad, see Chapter 3.

==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,
Chris

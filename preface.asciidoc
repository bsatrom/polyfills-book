== A Book on Polyfilling? Really? 

When it comes to the act of patching browser capabilities via polyfills, developers fall into two camps: those *using* polyfills to provide modern web platform capabilities in their sites, and those building polyfills for the broader web community. The book is meant for the latter camp, and is intended to serve as an introduction to polyfilling, to provide a set of principles and practical guidelines for building _reliable polyfills_, and finally, to provide a roadmap for the future of polyfilling. As I shared previously, that future is the construction of polyfills that add developer-defined and cutting-edge features into the browser as a way to prove the value of new and unproven APIs.

At present, countless articles and book chapters exist which cover the subject of polyfilling. However, in nearly every case, these articles are targeted at polyfill consumers, and not the intrepid developers who build these libraries. One notable exception is http://addyosmani.com/blog/writing-polyfills[Addy Osmani's guide for Polyfill developers], an introductory read that I highly recommend. Beyond Addy's article, there are few resources, online or in print, which cover the topic of polyfills from the viewpoint of the polyfill developer. A lack of definitive resources for building these libraries means that we, as developers must strike out on our own, or slowly dig through other libraries for patterns and ideas.

My sincere hope is that this book will "close the gap" by serving as a fieldbook for polyfill developers. We'll start with a cursory introduction to polyfilling on the web platform, and I'll share some principles and guidelines for building polyfills that developers can rely on. Once the guidelines have been established, we'll shift the discussion to an in-depth walkthrough of building a real-life, reasonably complex polyfill, by example.

Once Iâ€™ve covered the ins-and outs of building polyfills, the last few chapters will shift the focus to that emerging trend on the web platform: the "forward polyfill," or _prollyfill_. This pattern, as I've mentioned already, enables developers to test and work with emerging concepts, sometimes ahead of the browser vendors themselves. By the time we're done, you'll have all the tools you need to build reliable polyfills for the present, and the future, of the web. Let's get started, shall we?

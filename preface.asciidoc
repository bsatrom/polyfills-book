== Preface

If you play a game of word association with a room full of front-end developers, _polyfill_ will no-doubt receive mention from more than a few participants. This word, traditionally a synonym for _fallback_, _spackle_ or _patch_--unfamiliar to many developers until just a few years ago--has become a staple of conversations about modern and open web technologies. And while polyfilling has traditionally operated as a practice for delivering modern features to non-modern browsers (_oldIE_, meaning IE 6-8, is increasingly a synonym for this term), the concept has expanded over the last few years to include the addition of new and experimental platform features to _all browsers_, including the newest and most cutting-edge.

Before our eyes, the practice of polyfilling is evolving from an adoption technique to a full-blown design pattern that allows developers to "spackle" their browsers with whatever semantics they wish. AngularJS, a very popular and fast-growing app framework, encourages this practice by enabling developers to use directives to add custom HTML tags and components to their applications.

Design by polyfill extends beyond frameworks, as well. Once such example is the Web Components effort, a set of specifications in the W3C designed to make the creation of custom semantics and encapsulated components a feature in the browser itself. With Web Components, if you want a <calendar> component, you need only create one yourself, or grab one from a third party. It's a powerful idea, and if the concept takes off, it will unlock a new set of capabilities for web developers, while adding new depth and richness to the applications we create.

=== Who This Book Is For

When it comes to the art of patching browser capabilities via polyfills, developers fall into two camps: those *using* polyfills to provide modern web platform capabilities in their sites, and those *building* polyfills for the broader web community. The book is primarily focused on the latter camp, and is intended to serve as an introduction to polyfilling, to provide a set of principles and practical guidelines for building _reliable polyfills_, and finally, to provide a roadmap for the future of polyfilling itself. However, even if you're a JavaScript developer not especially interested in building polyfills, there's a lot of useful content in this book in the realm of Test-Driven Development (TDD), JavaScript build workflows and performance optimizations.

At present, countless articles and book chapters exist which cover the subject of polyfilling. However, in nearly every case, these articles are targeted at polyfill consumers, and not the intrepid developers who build these libraries. One notable exception is http://addyosmani.com/blog/writing-polyfills[Addy Osmani's guide for polyfill developers], an introductory read that I highly recommend. Beyond Addy's article, there are few resources, online or in print, which cover the topic of polyfills from the viewpoint of the polyfill developer. A lack of definitive resources for building these libraries means that we, as developers must strike out on our own, or slowly dig through other libraries for patterns and ideas.

My sincere hope is that this book will "close the gap" by serving as a fieldbook for polyfill developers. We'll start with a cursory introduction to polyfilling on the web platform, and I'll share some principles and guidelines for building polyfills that developers can rely on. Once the guidelines have been established, we'll shift the discussion to an in-depth walkthrough of building a real-life, reasonably complex polyfill, by example.

Once I’ve covered the ins-and outs of building polyfills, the last few chapters will shift to focus on that emerging trend on the web platform: the "forward polyfill," or _prollyfill_. This pattern, as I've mentioned already, enables developers to test and work with emerging concepts, sometimes ahead of the browser vendors themselves. By the time we're done, you'll have all the tools you need to build reliable polyfills for the present, and the future, of the web.

=== How This Book is Organized

This book is organized into two parts. In the first part, we discuss the ins and outs of polyfill development, starting with the current landscape of polyfilling in <<polyfills_chapter_1>>. In <<polyfills_chapter_2>>, I'll introduce some principles and practices for the polyfill developer, guidance that I hope you'll find useful regardless of the type of polyfill you plan to build. Then, in Chapters 3-5, we'll dig deep into polyfill development with a real-life library. In <<polyfills_chapter_3>>, I'll introduce our sample project, an HTML5 Forms polyfill, and we'll build out several features for this library. In <<polyfills_chapter_4>> we'll talk about testing and build workflows, and I'll introduce you to some tools that can make your life easier as a polyfill developer. Finally, we'll wrap up part one with a discussion on polyfill performance in <<polyfills_chapter_5>> where I'll walk through a couple of cases in which we can improve the speed of our polyfill.

In part two of this book, we'll turn our focus to the future of polyfilling, the _prollyfill_. In <<polyfills_chapter_6>>, I'll introduce the concept of _prollyfilling_ and walk through examples of this important variation on the polyfill. Finally, in <<polyfills_chapter_7>>, we'll close out the book with another walkthrough and build a _prollyfill_ for a cutting-edge web platform specification. Once we're done, you should be well-equipped to jump into the present, and future, of polyfilling.

<remark>Fill in...</remark>

First and foremost, thanks go to my wife, Sarah, who's faith in me is equal parts unflagging and humbling. I am ever grateful for her encouragement to take on these kinds of projects, while also keeping me honest and engaged with my family. It is because of her that I don't have to apologize for countless nights of missed dinners and time lost with our family, because no such sacrifice was required. I hope you'll agree that the quality of this work did not suffer, as a result.

I'm also grateful to my boys, Benjamin and Jack, who's smiles and playful spirits remind me of what really matters each and every day. Thanks for all of the writing interruptions for hugs and kisses, boys! Also, to Baby Satrom #3. Though this book was completed before you were born, you were constantly in my thoughts. I can't wait to meet you in early 2014!

Thanks also to my fantastic colleagues at Telerik, especially Burke Holland, who reviewed every single line of this book and provided immensely helpful feedback when I was deep in the weeds of polyfilling. Thanks also for Addy Osmani who, in addition to writing the Foreward, provided early input on the proposal and table of contents for this book. Any "aha!" moments you have while reading this book are due to the insight of these two gentlemen, while any "WTF's" are solely the fault of their author.

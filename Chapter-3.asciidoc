== Building Your First Polyfill, Part 1: Getting Started

Over the last two chapters, we've covered why polyfilling is still important, as well as some principles for responsible polyfill development. In this chapter, I'm going to walk through some practical steps for building cross-browser polyfills via an actual, real-world project that I created. We won't go through every line of code or every excruciating detail, but I will introduce you to some practical examples and considerations that you'll want to keep in mind for your own polyfill development, no matter the web platform feature being targeted. We'll start with a discussion on project setup and structure before diving into setting up your API and deciding what you plan to build and not to build. Then we'll explore adding basic features and refactoring your polyfill as you expand scope over time. We'll then wrap up the chapter with a look at manual cross-browser testing, and some tips for streamlining your cross-browser testing workflow. 

=== The HTML5 Forms Polyfill

First, let's take a look at our candidate library for the next two chapters: an HTML5 Forms polyfill. When I first set out to write this book, I considered a lot of different options for a guinea pig polyfill to use. I wanted to target something that was reasonably complex, but straightforward enough to introduce in bits and pieces, via text. I also wanted to choose a technology that’s implementation status across browsers was more than just "supported in everything but IE." And even though IE will factor into some of the hairier aspects of our polyfill development, I wanted to walk through an example with quirks in as many browsers as possible. For those purposes, there’s no better technology to attempt to polyfill than HTML5 Forms.

What we know of today as "HTML5 Forms" was actually the first technology to be proposed under the umbrella of what eventually became HTML5. First introduced outside the W3C as Web Forms 2.0 by a consortium of browser vendors that included Google, Mozilla, Opera Software, and Apple, this proposal arrived at a time when the W3C was still pouring much of its effort into the now-defunct XHTML 2.0 specification. As an outflow of Web Forms 2.0, these vendors formed the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a sibling standards body to the W3C that still exists today.

And while it is outside of the scope of this book to discuss the politics of HTML5, various collected standards, and competing standards bodies, it is important to note that HTML5 Forms has not only been around a while, but it’s still one of the most hotly debated aspects of the HTML5 spec. While certain aspects of the Forms spec have near universal support (for example, forms constraint validation), some of the more visual aspects of the spec (new input types like number, color, and datetime) have yet to be consistently implemented across all browsers, as illustrated in <<EX3-1a>>. What’s more, in some cases, for those browsers that do support certain types, the specifics of said support are often inconsistent from one implementation to the next. This means that you, the developer, might not get exactly the behavior you expect, every time, in every browser.

[[EX3-1a]]

HTML5 Forms is a minefield, and I can't think of a better area in which to venture as a polyfill developer. It’s a bit hairy, for sure, but this area of the spec is sufficiently complex enough to expose many of the polyfilling practices that I introduced in the preceding chapter.

In addition to targeting HTML5 Forms with my polyfill, I've chosen to leverage http://kendoui.com[Kendo UI] to provide much of the functionality that my polyfill will deliver to older browsers, from visual elements like color and date pickers, to key framework-level features like form validation. All of the UI widgets and framework features I need for my polyfill are available in the open source version of Kendo UI, which is available from http://www.kendoui.com[its website]. That said, if you're following along and prefer to instead use a UI library like http://jqueryui.com[jQuery UI], you're welcome to do so. In fact, I've built a version of this polyfill using jQuery UI, and you can http://bit.ly/ui-forms[find it on GitHub]. Very little of what I cover in this chapter is dependent upon and applicable to only Kendo UI. 

==== Why Use a Library?

At this point, you may be asking yourself why I've chosen to use a library like jQuery UI or Kendo UI at all. Why not just build the UI for each input type from scratch? It's a valid question, and in fact there are several great HTML5 Forms libraries out there that take this approach. If you're interested in taking a look at the code required to deliver UI widgets from scratch, I encourage you to check one of these out.

In our case, however, I've chosen to use a UI library because it allows me to focus on the process of building polyfills, which is, after all, what this book is about. By starting with a library that I can plug in, I'm able to focus on tips and tricks that are common to all types of polyfills, without getting bogged down in the very complex specifics of building form UI by hand.

[NOTE]
====
The HTML5 Forms polyfill we will be building over the next three chapters can be found in its current form online on http://bit.ly/kendo-ui[GitHub]. The project is actively maintained, and you're welcome to view the source after reading this book if you want to dig deeper into any specifics that I was unable to cover here.
====

Finally, it's worth mentioning that I've decided to build my HTML5 Forms polyfill as an opt-in polyfill, as opposed to a drop-in library. While it's certainly possible to do the latter, I think the former is a better approach, in my case, for a couple of reasons. For starters, since I'm using Kendo UI to power my widgets, and Kendo UI requires explicit widget initialization, I feel that it's appropriate for me to do the same with my polyfill and require that the developer activate the capabilities of my polyfill. I've also chosen to pursue an opt-in approach because the HTML5 Forms spec is so broad and complex that I'm not sure if my library will ever be able to support every single corner of the spec to the letter. By taking an opt-in approach, and documenting what I do and don't support, I can make sure that the developers know what they are buying into.

That said, even though my polyfill is opt-in, it doesn't mean that I can't future-proof my library. Just as with a drop-in polyfill, my goal is to provide a polyfill that can be easily removed (along with a line or two of code) when all browsers support the HTML5 Forms spec.

=== Setting Up Your Polyfill Project

Regardless of the technology you choose to target with your polyfill, the two most important choices that you can make early on are: 

* Which source control solution you plan to use 

* What your initial project structure will look like. 

Sure, you can start with "Source Control by Dropbox" at the beginning and name your polyfill +mylib.js+ if you're just itching to get started, but a little bit of foresight and planning is, in my opinion, just as important to polyfill development as the code you write. As such, I'll use the next few sections to talk about these early considerations.

==== Choosing a Source Control Solution

The first step is to think about how and where you’ll want to host your code so that you’ve got a backup and full project history in case things go wrong so other developers can find, leverage, and contribute to your project. For the first part, you’ll want to choose a source control solution that’s open source and widely used. Two examples are http://git-scm.com/[Git] and http://mercurial.selenic.com/[Mercurial]. These two systems have a similar command-line syntax for working with files and code repositories, so some developers will be comfortable working with either. That said, Git is far and away the most popular source control system in use today, so you’ll reach a larger body of potential collaborators by choosing that system.

When paired with a solid code-sharing site, your source control solution also gives you a platform for making your polyfill available to the world. You can not only store your polyfill source and history in these sites, but also make that source and history available for others, which is hopefully your goal as a polyfill developer. Just as Git is the most popular source control option around today, https://github.com/[GitHub] is the most popular option for hosting and collaborating on all manner of Git-based open source software projects. Other options worth considering, if GitHub is not your cup of tea, are http://www.bitbucket.com/[Bitbucket]&#x00D7;which allows you to host both Git and Mercurial projects, and Microsoft’s http://www.codeplex.com/[CodePlex]&#x00D7;which supports Mercurial projects only. For the examples in this book, I’ve chosen Git as my source control solution and GitHub for code sharing and distribution.

==== Setting Up the Initial Project Structure

Once I've chosen a source control solution, I'm ready to set up my project. I'll start by creating a new folder for my polyfill, called +kendo-ui-forms+ in my usual development folder on my machine. Then, I'll open a terminal window in that directory and initialize a new GitHub repo by running the **`git init`** command. Once you’ve initialized your own local Git repository, you’ll want to connect it to the remote repository that will be hosting your project online, which you can do by running the following command: **`git remote add git@github.com:_++yourusername++_/_++your-project-name++s_.git`**. If you're not familiar with setting up a new remote repository, head over to http://www.github.com[GitHub], create a new repository for your project, and follow the on-screen instructions.

With that done, your local and remote repositories will be all set up, and it will be time to add some essential project files. Here's the basic project structure I recommend for most open source polyfills (assuming a view from the folder root):

+dist/+:: The minified and concatenated files you plan to distribute (the "binaries" for your polyfill).

+lib/+:: Any third party libraries that your polyfill depends on (jQuery, Underscore).

+sample/+:: Sample and example code for the polyfill.

+spec/+:: Home for your unit tests, which we'll discuss in <<polyfills_chapter_4>>.

+src/[js,css]+:: Source JavaScript and CSS files.

+.gitignore+:: A list of files for Git to ignore when found in your project. GitHub can create one of these files for you when creating a new project. If you go that route, select the Node template.

+CHANGELOG.md+:: A laundry list of minor and breaking changes for each version of your library. 

+CONTRIBUTING.md+:: Essential if you plan to accept contributions for your project. 

+README.md+:: The readme file for your project. GitHub automatically treats this file as the main entry point when anyone visits your project. It should describe the purpose and goals of the polyfill--as I discussed in <<polyfills_chapter_1>>&#x00D7;features of the project, a road map for the projects, installation and usage instructions, and anything else you think might be useful to consumers of or collaborators on your polyfill.

+LICENSE.md+:: Every open source project needs a license. Which license you choose is up to you, but permissive licenses, such as MIT and Apache 2.0, will garner more interest and, possibly, participation from other developers. GitHub can also generate this file for you, based on the license chosen at project creation. 

[NOTE]
====
Though I did take the LSAT once upon a time, please note that I am not an attorney, nor do I play one on the Internet. As such, my opinions on licensing should not be confused for legal expertise. Your best bet is to consult with a legal expert before choosing an open source license. You can also visit http://choosealicense.com/[Choose A License] for more information about the dizzying array of open source licenses available. But still, you should talk to a lawyer if you want an expert legal perspective in your choice of license. 
====

=== Specifying the API

Once your polyfill project is set up, your next important decision is determining how other developers will "call" your polyfill, if at all. As you'll recall from <<polyfills_chapter_1>>, two of the important subtypes of polyfills are the opt-in and drop-in types. If you're building a drop-in polyfill, that essentially means that developers need only include a reference to your library in their projects. When your script is loaded, it automatically activates and goes to work. For these types of polyfills, the API of your library is straightforward and should match the API of the specified functionality you're emulating, as much as possible.

If, on the other hand, you're building an opt-in polyfill, you'll need to provide some mechanism for developers to activate your library. How you choose to expose your polyfill to developers is up to you, but I recommend considering your audience, specifically what they are likely to expect and be comfortable with, as you design your API. For examples of how other libraries expose their opt-in APIs, you can check out examples on the http://bit.ly/mod-list[Modernizr Polyfill List]. Since the HTML5 Forms polyfill I'm building will leverage Kendo UI, I've chosen to build my polyfill as a custom Kendo UI widget. Building my polyfill as a Kendo UI widget, I can use Kendo UI's ready-made options for initializing my library. As a result, I gain an initialization API for my polyfill that's easy to use and familiar to developers, especially those already familiar with Kendo UI.

==== Initializing an Opt-In Polyfill

Kendo UI allows developers to initialize widgets in one of two ways. I can use jQuery-style widget initialization, as illustrated in <<EX3-1>>, or I can use a declarative-style declaration, which hinges on placing +data-role+ attributes on relevant elements in my markup. This approach is illustrated in <<EX3-2>>. Note that the next few examples assume the inclusion of jQuery, Kendo UI JavaScript, and Kendo UI CSS in the page.

[[EX3-1]]
.Initializing my Forms polyfill using JavaScript
====
[source, html]
----
<form id="myForm">
  <!-- Rest of form declaration -->
</form>
<script>
  $('#myForm').kendoForm();
</script>
----
====

[[EX3-2]]
.Initializing my Forms polyfill via declarative initialization
====
[source, html]
----
<form action="input.html" data-role="form">
  <!-- Rest of form declaration -->
</form>
<script>
  kendo.init(document.body);
</script>
----
====

To support both of these approaches in my polyfill, I'll need to follow Kendo UI's recommended approach for creating custom widgets. First, I'll create the core source file for my polyfill in the +src/+ folder for my project. I'll call it +kendo.forms.js+, which follows a naming convention similar to other Kendo UI source files. Then, in my new source file, I'll include the code in <<EX3-3>>.

[[EX3-3]]
.Initial skeleton for the Kendo UI Forms polyfill
====
[source, js]
----
(function($, kendo) {
  var ui = kendo.ui,
    Widget = ui.Widget;
    
  var Form = Widget.extend({
    init: function(element, options) {
      // base call to widget initialization
      Widget.fn.init.call(this, element, options);
    },
    options: {
      // the name is what it will appear in the kendo namespace (kendo.ui.Form).
      // The jQuery plug-in would be jQuery.fn.kendoForm.
      name: 'Form'
    }
  });

  ui.plugin(Form);
} (jQuery, kendo));
----
====

As illustrated here, my polyfill starts with an http://bit.ly/i-ife[Immediately-Invoked Function Expression] (IIFE) that specifies my dependencies, jQuery and Kendo UI in this case. Next, I create some local lookup variables to cache key parts of the Kendo UI namespace. Then, I create a new Form variable by calling the +kendo.ui.Widget.extend()+ method, which takes care of handling the initialization types I specified. Finally, I'll call the +kendo.ui.plugin()+ method and pass in my +Form+ widget, which adds my polyfill to the widget registry for runtime lookup and evaluation.

For my HTML5 Forms polyfill, this is all I need to create a public API for initializing my library. With this skeleton code in place, I can now use either initialization method described in <<EX3-1>> and <<EX3-2>>, and things will resolve. My polyfill won't do anything at this point, but it will run without errors, so that's progress!

With the opt-in API of our library set, we can move on to building out the core functionality of our polyfill. Regardless of the type of polyfill you're building, much of the API you'll be exposing should already be decided for you via the specification for the technology you're targeting. As discussed in the preceding chapter, it's important to adhere to this specification as much as possible. If you're planning to support an aspect of the spec, you should try your best to support it _as specced_. You should also be clear in your documentation and in-source comments which aspects of the spec you support and which you don't. 

=== Deciding What to Build

Speaking of which, the next important decision you need to make in your library is what to build. Even if you do plan to support every nook and cranny of a spec with your polyfill, you probably won't be able to bang out full support over a weekend. You need a plan, and if you're anything like me, you probably want to target simple features and "quick wins" first. This establishes a good foundation and a working polyfill before you tackle the hairier aspects of support. If you'd rather target the hard stuff first, that's OK too!

In the context of HTML5 Forms, the simpler features are those new input types like +color+, +number+, and +datetime+. Because Kendo UI Web has widgets for these, _supporting_ them is a simple matter of adding the Kendo UI widget when one of these types is found on a form. Validation support, on the other hand, is a bit trickier, so I'm going to put that off for later, perhaps after the first couple of releases.

Speaking of releases, this is probably a good time to think about the road map for your polyfill. Assuming you're talking about a complex feature, you'll probably want to write down what you plan to support, and when. For the HTML5 Forms polyfill, I chose to include a roadmap on the _readme_ for the project, which I've also included in <<EX3-4>>.

[[EX3-4]]
.Road map for the Kendo UI Forms polyfill
[options="header"]
|=======
|Release|Features
|v0.1   |Support upgrading all HTML5 input types (color, numeric, range, file, datetime, time, month, week).
|v0.1.1 |Button support and date type support
|v0.2   | Add support for progress and datalist elements; add a placeholder fallback and search box UI; autocomplete attribute support.
|v0.3   | Add validation support.
|=======

In addition to creating a road map and plan for your polyfill, you'll want to consider whether there's anything under the technology umbrella of your polyfill that you don't plan to or cannot support. Sometimes it's not possible to reliably polyfill an aspect of a specification, so you'll want to avoid even trying to support it. Other times, adding support for a given feature is possible, but not something you're prepared to take on. No matter the reason, be sure that your road map is clear about what you're not planning to polyfill so that developers are informed when considering your library. 

=== Adding Basic Features

So we've got our basic polyfill skeleton in place, an API for calling it, and a road map for which features we plan to add. Now it's time to get to work and add our first, real feature. Of course, if we're going to add features to our polyfill, we also need ways to test them out, don't we? In <<polyfills_chapter_4>>, I'll discuss setting up unit and cross-browser testing in depth, but in the meantime, let's create a sample form that we can use to test out our library as we work on it. This sample will serve as a live demonstration and part of our docs when we publish our polyfill, so it's something you'll want to add to your projects even if you're also performing automated testing. Consider it a way to show off all your hard work to your potential users.

==== Creating a Sample Form

To that end, let's create a new HTML page in the +samples/+ folder and call it +form.html+. Since our library is an HTML5 Forms polyfill, it makes sense that the sample page itself contain a form showing off all of our bells and whistles. Since this sample page will also serve as a part of my docs, the HTML page, which you can view in the https://github.com/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms[online repo for this project], will include references to bootstrap and some additional markup that I've not included in <<EX3-04>>. The relevant portion of this sample page, the form itself, is shown in <<EX3-4>>.

[[EX3-04]]

    <input type="submit" formnovalidate value="Save for later" />
  </div>

====

As you can see from the sample, it's a pretty robust form, and it also uses all of the new HTML5 Forms features introduced in the spec, like new input types (such as +color+ and +datetime+), new attributes ( like +autocomplete+, +pattern+, or +required+) and form validation features. To give you an idea of what this form looks like in various browsers, <<EX3-5>> shows what our form looks like, by default, in Chrome 29, while <<EX3-6>> shows what the form looks like in Safari 6.1. Notice the difference in the date fields, the color field, and others. We've certainly got our work cut out for us with this polyfill, even without taking oldIE into account!

With my sample form in place, I'll next need to add a reference to my polyfill source file. In <<EX3-3>>, we created the main +kendo.forms.js+ file, which included the skeleton for our Forms widget and polyfill. I'll add a reference to that file in my sample form, and then add a script block or new file reference to activate the sample form, as illustrated in <<EX3-7>>.

Now, if I refresh the page in my browser, I'll see… that nothing is different. I'm not getting any console errors though, which means that my polyfill is being properly initialized. All that's left is to add some real functionality. So, without further ado, let's add that much anticipated first feature.

==== The First Feature: Color Support

When I created the roadmap for my polyfill, I decided to tackle new input types first, and build up in complexity from there. The first type I'll add support for is the color option, which is covered in section http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/number-state.html#color-state[4.10.7.1.15 of the HTML5 Forms spec]. Here's the text of that section.

.Color State Section of the HTML5 Forms Spec
[quote, W3C HTML Working Group, http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/number-state.html#color-state]
____
*4.10.7.1.15 Color state*

When an input element's type attribute is in the Color state, the rules in this section apply.

The input element represents a _color well control_, for setting the element's value to a string representing a http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/common-microsyntaxes.html#simple-color[simple color].

_Note: In this state, there is always a color picked, and there is no way to set the value to the empty string._

If the element is mutable, the user agent should allow the user to change the color represented by its value, as obtained from applying the rules for parsing simple color values to it. User agents must not allow the user to set the value to a string that is not a valid lowercase simple color. If the user agent provides a user interface for selecting a color, then the value must be set to the result of using the http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/common-microsyntaxes.html#rules-for-serializing-simple-color-values[rules for serializing simple color values] to the user's selection. User agents must not allow the user to set the value to the empty string.

The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that is a valid simple color.

*The value sanitization algorithm is as follows*: If the value of the element is a valid simple color, then set it to the value of the element converted to ASCII lowercase; otherwise, set it to the string "#000000".

*Bookkeeping details*

- The following common input element content attributes, IDL attributes, and methods apply to the element: autocomplete and list content attributes; list, value, and selectedOption IDL attributes.
- The value IDL attribute is in mode value.
- The input and change events apply.
- The following content attributes must not be specified and do not apply to the element: accept, alt, checked, dirname, formaction, formenctype, formmethod, formnovalidate, formtarget, height, maxlength, max, min, multiple, pattern, placeholder, readonly, required, size, src, step, and width.
- The following IDL attributes and methods do not apply to the element: checked, files, selectionStart, selectionEnd, selectionDirection, valueAsDate, and valueAsNumber IDL attributes; select(), setSelectionRange(), stepDown(), and stepUp() methods.
____

As noted in the text above, the "Color" type is intended to offer a simple "color well" control that supports visual selection of simple colors and retrieval of sRGB or Hexadecimal equivalents of these. There's a lot of W3C-speak in the section above, the rules for implementing a color input type in a browser are pretty straightforward:

1. The value attribute of an input with a type of "color" is a seven character string ("#" and six characters for the color value) that represents a valid sRGB color.
2. A valid color value must always be selected; null and empty string values are not permitted.
3. The default color value string is "#000000", or black.
4. The UI for the color type must be a mask input; That is, it will not accept values that do not represent a valid sRGB color.
5. The string value for the color input should always be represented by a lowercase string, and converted to a lowercase string upon input, if uppercase characters are used.

You can see from <<EX3-5>> above that Chrome supports this attribute, while Safari 6.1 does not, as shown in <<EX3-6>> (Safari simply shows the hex value I set in the sample form). Coincidentally, Kendo UI Web provides a http://demos.kendoui.com/web/colorpicker/index.html[+ColorPicker+] widget that follows all of the rules above, so this control is a great first addition to our polyfill.

When I initialize my polyfill by calling +kendoForm()+ (or via the declarative approach), the +init()+ method in <<EX3-3>> will be fired, so that's the right place to start adding my functionality. Inside that method, and just after the call to +Widget.fn.init+, I can add my color type code, as illustrated in <<EX3-8>>.

.Adding color type support to the Forms polyfill

      Widget.fn.init.call(this, element, options);

  });

  ui.plugin(Form);
} (jQuery, kendo));
----
====

In this sample, I'm looking for every input on my form with the attribute +type=color+ and initializing a +kendoColorPicker+ for each, using the +basic+ pallete option. The HTML5 specification doesn't have anything to say about what the color control should look like or how it should behave, visually, so I've chosen a sensible default for the +ColorPicker+. Now, when I view the sample form in Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer (all browsers which do not support the color type at the time of writing), I'll see a Kendo UI ColorPicker in place of the default text input, as seen in <<EX3-9>>.

==== To Feature Detect, or Not to Feature Detect

Of course, there's a catch. As it happens, if you view the sample page in a browser that _does_ support the color type (like Chrome or Opera), you'll notice that a ColorPicker was created in these browsers, as well. This is because my current implementation doesn't bother to perform feature detection for the color type, instead overriding every occurrence of the type on every browser.

[NOTE]
====
_Feature detection_ is the practice of executing code in the browser for the purpose of determining whether that browser supports a given feature or not. The practice is considered superior to the classical practice of _Browser or User-Agent Sniffing_ because, rather than making wholesale decisions about which features to provide to a user based on the browser they're using, you can enable or disable functionality at the feature level, based on support, regardless of the browser in use.
====

When building a cross-browser polyfill, you'll need to consider how you wish to approach feature detection for your library. You have two choices:

. Require that the user perform feature detection before including or opting-in to your polyfill
. Perform feature detection on behalf of (or in addition to) the user

The first approach is common for polyfills that cover a limited feature-set, or those that are activated on a per-element or frequent basis. As http://modernizr.com[Modernizr] is widely used by developers, it's common to see polyfills used in a manner similar to <<EX1-3>> from <<polyfills_chapter_1>>. In this example, I'm  using Modernizr to query for CSS Border Radius support and, if it's not available in the user's browser, I'll opt-in to PIE for a given set of elements.

When building polyfills that are a bit more expansive, or even more "intrusive" in the functionality they provide, I recommend performing feature detection on the developer's behalf. In the case of HTML5 Forms, my polyfill is instantiated at the form-level, so asking the user to perform feature detection before calling my library would be an all-or-nothing proposition that would lead to my library being used for all HTML5 Forms features, or none of them at all. Instead, I'd rather provide the ability for the polyfill to selectively upgrade only those features *not* supported in the browser.

To check for support for the color +input+ type, I'll create a function inside of my +init+ function to test for support for individual form types:

[[EX3-9.1]]
.Testing for input type support
====
[source, js]
----
function isFormTypeSupported(type) {
  if (type === 'text') { return true; }

  var input = document.createElement('input');
  input.setAttribute('type', type);
  return input.type !== 'text';
}
----
====

First, I'll create an in-memory +input+ element, then set it's +type+ attribute to the type variable provided by the caller. Finally, I'll check the type attribute. If its value is  still "text" even after I set it to another value, such as "color", that means that the browser does *not* support this input type. As such, I'll return false. If the value is retained, browser support is available, and I'll return true.

To leverage this home-grown feature detection method, I'll modify the code in <<EX3-8>> to first check for support, as shown in <<EX3-10>>. Now, if I refresh Chrome or Opera, the built-in browser support is back, while custom widget support provided by my polyfill will be leveraged for all other browsers.

[[EX3-10]]
.Checking for color type support before adding a ColorPicker widget
====
[source, js]
----
if (!isFormTypeSupported('color')) {
  form.find('input[type=color]').kendoColorPicker({ palette: 'basic' });
}
----
====

==== Adding Opt-In "Overrides" to Your Polyfill

Once I add feature detection to my polyfill, the color type will only be "upgraded" when the browser doesn't support this type. This is excellent for a default behavior, but what if the developer *wants* to author HTML5 Forms markup *and* have all of their form fields upgraded to widgets, regardless of browser support? This is obviously a case that falls outside of specified HTML5 Forms behavior, but it's a feature I've chosen to add in my forms polyfill, for a couple of reasons:

. As an opt-in polyfill, allowing developers to pass in options is easy.
. Since the visual aspects of HTML5 Forms vary greatly from one browser to the next, even between browsers that *support* a new type, some developers may prefer the ability to author HTML5 forms markup while gaining a consistent look and feel for visual widgets, across browsers. It's downright "prollyfill-esque," but we'll get to that.

If you recall that one of our "responsible polyfilling" principles in <<polyfills_chapter_2>> is "mind (only) the gaps," you probably think I'm contradicting myself right now by adding override capabilities to my library. And while an argument can be made for leaving out a feature such as this, I believe that it's a feature that adds value to the developer and end user by providing the ability to apply a consistent form UI across browsers. As such, I think it's appropriate. What's more, since the feature I'm adding doesn't "break" the end-user experience on supporting browsers if the polyfill is removed--it merely changes the look and feel of HTML5 Forms fields--I don't see it as a violation of the principle. Bottom line: these are principles, not rules. As the polyfill developer, you get to decide which ones to follow and which to discard, with good reason. If consumers of your library don't agree, they'll let you know.

To add an "override" for visual elements to my polyfill, I can leverage the built-in +options+ object required by all Kendo UI widgets. In <<EX3-3>>, we used this object to specify the name of our widget, +Form+, which Kendo UI uses when adding our polyfill to the library namespace. I can use this object to specify any number of developer-defined features, and I'll use it now to add an +alwaysUseWidgets+ boolean value. Once I've added that option, I'll modify my +isFormTypeSupported+ method to check for this property. If +alwaysUseWidgets+ is true, I'll skip the feature detection test and return +false+. The full listing for our polyfill source including color type support and the override is shown in <<EX3-11>>.

[[EX3-11]]

  var Form = Widget.extend({
    init: function(element, options) {
      var form = $(element),
          that = this;

      // base call to widget initialization
      Widget.fn.init.call(this, element, options);

      function isFormTypeSupported(type) {
        if (type === 'text') { return true; }
  
        if (that.options.alwaysUseWidgets) { <1>
          return false;
        }

        var input = document.createElement('input');
        input.setAttribute('type', type);
        return input.type !== 'text';
      }

      if (!isFormTypeSupported('color')) {
        form.find('input[type=color]').kendoColorPicker({ palette: 'basic' });
      }
    },
    options: {
      // the name is what it will appear in the kendo namespace (kendo.ui.Form).
      // The jQuery plugin would be jQuery.fn.kendoForm.
      name: 'Form',
      alwaysUseWidgets: false <2>
    }
  });

  ui.plugin(Form);
} (jQuery, kendo));
----
<1> Test the override property to determine if the element should always be upgraded
<2> Specify the override property and set the default value to false
====

With this functionality in place, I can modify my initialization  code to pass in the +alwaysUseWidgets+ option:

====
[source, js]
----
$('#sampleForm').kendoForm({ alwaysUseWidgets: true });
----
====

Now, the Kendo UI ColorPicker widget will be used in all browsers.

=== Beefing up Your Polyfill with Additional Features

So far, we've added basic support for the color +input+ type, feature detection for that type and the ability to override detection and always upgrade the type to use a UI widget. And while it's nice to have support for a single type, it doesn't make for a terribly useful polyfill. Let's expand our polyfill by adding support for an additional input type.

==== Adding Support for the Number Type

The next feature for which I'll add support in my polyfill is the +number+ input type, which is covered in [section 4.10.7.1.13 of the HTML5 Forms specification]:

.Number State Section of the HTML5 Forms Spec
[quote, W3C HTML Working Group, http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/number-state.html#number-state]
____
*4.10.7.1.13 Number state*

When an input element's type attribute is in the *Number* state, the rules in this section apply.

The input element represents a control for setting the element's value to a string representing a number.

If the element is mutable, the user agent should allow the user to change the number represented by its value, as obtained from applying the rules for parsing floating point number values to it. User agents must not allow the user to set the value to a non-empty string that is not a valid floating point number. If the user agent provides a user interface for selecting a number, then the value must be set to the best representation of the number representing the user's selection as a floating point number. User agents should allow the user to set the value to the empty string.

The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that is a valid floating point number.

*The value sanitization algorithm is as follows*: If the value of the element is not a valid floating point number, then set it to the empty string instead.

The *min* attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid floating point number. The *max* attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid floating point number.

The *step* scale factor is 1. The default step is 1 (allowing only integers, unless the min attribute has a non-integer value).

When the element is suffering from a step mismatch, the user agent may round the element's value to the nearest number for which the element would not suffer from a step mismatch. If there are two such numbers, user agents are encouraged to pick the one nearest positive infinity.

*The algorithm to convert a string to a number, given a string input, is as follows*: If applying the rules for parsing floating point number values to input results in an error, then return an error; otherwise, return the resulting number.

*The algorithm to convert a number to a string, given a number input, is as follows*: Return a valid floating point number that represents input.

*Bookkeeping details*
- The following common input element content attributes, IDL attributes, and methods apply to the element: autocomplete, list, max, min, readonly, required, and step content attributes; list, value, valueAsNumber, and selectedOption IDL attributes; stepDown() and stepUp() methods.
- The value IDL attribute is in mode value.
- The input and change events apply.
- The following content attributes must not be specified and do not apply to the element: accept, alt, checked, dirname, formaction, formenctype, formmethod, formnovalidate, formtarget, height, maxlength, multiple, pattern, placeholder, size, src, and width.
- The following IDL attributes and methods do not apply to the element: checked, files, selectionStart, selectionEnd, selectionDirection, and valueAsDate IDL attributes; select() and setSelectionRange() methods.

As detailed in the spec, the number type is basically an edit mask that ensures that a user only enter numeric values into fields given the +type="number"+ attribute value. Let's take the wall of text above and translate it into some simple rules:

1. The value attribute of an input with a type of "number" is a floating point number.
2. A valid number value is *not* required at all times. If a valid number is not selected, the value is "empty string."
3. If the user attempts to enter an invalid or non-numeric value, the input value should be set to "empty string."
4. The "min" and "max" attributes are allowed on this input, and should both represent valid floating point numbers.
5. The "step" attribute is allowed and has a default value of 1, which allows only integers to be specified).
6. If the value of the input is set programmatically and that value   violates the specified "step" property (i.e. step is 1 and a value of 2.88 is set), the control should round the set value up or down based on rounding rules (in this example, the value would be set to 3).

Just as with the color type, Kendo UI Web has a http://demos.kendoui.com/web/numerictextbox/index.html[NumericTestBox] widget that functions as a nice edit mask control for floating point values, so we'll use this widget to polyfill non-supporting browsers. <<EX3-12>> contains the +number+ specific code that I'll add to +kendo.forms.js+, just after my color type code:

[[EX3-12]]
.Adding number input type support to my Forms polyfill
====
[source, js]
----
if (!isFormTypeSupported('number')) {
  form.find('input[type=number]').kendoNumericTextBox();
}
----
====

To test this feature out, I can load my sample form up in a browser that doesn't support the number type, like IE9 or Firefox, or use the +alwaysUseWidgets+ option. It works like a charm, and you'll also notice that attributes like +min+ and +max+, which I specified for the age field on my sample form In <<EX3-4>>, were preserved by the Kendo UI NumericTextBox widget. I get that for free, which is awesome. 

Even still, I can't help but get this creeping feeling that things could be better. To see what I mean, let's look at our two features together:

[[EX3-13]]
.Color and Number Type Support
====
[source, js]
----
if (!isFormTypeSupported('color')) {
  form.find('input[type=color]').kendoColorPicker({ palette: 'basic' });
}

if (!isFormTypeSupported('number')) {
  form.find('input[type=number]').kendoNumericTextBox();
}
----
====

Repetition everywhere! And while it doesn't look *terrible* with only two features, I can't even bear the thought of what my polyfill will look like once I add support for all of the 12+ visual types and features. So, before we add our next input type, it's time to refactor!

[NOTE]
====
Refactoring is the practice of reorganizing code for maintenance, readability and ease of use, while leaving its behavior unchanged. It's most often associated with the agile discipline of TDD (where the phrase "Red, Green, Refactor" was born), but it's a useful practice regardless of your specific development workflow. That said, refactoring is *worlds* easier when your production code is covered by a good suite of unit tests. And though I'm going to perform my refactor without a safety net now, I'll be covering unit testing, as well as some performance-driven refactoring in Chapters 4 and 5.
====

==== Refactoring Type Support

When refactoring JavaScript code, I prefer to think not just of the refactor that will benefit my current code, but the code I plan to add next. This might sound like a bit of "You ain't gonna need it" (or YAGNI) to you, but there are cases when I do indeed know "But I'm gonnna need it, and soon." (I tried to coin the acronym _BIGNIAS_ for this, but it doesn't quite roll off the tongue) Such is the case with my polyfill, where I know that much of the process of adding support for additional types will be consistent from one type to the next, with only a few, specific differences. 

Because of this, the first step in my refactor is to move all of my +input+ type specific upgrades into a "lookup table," essentially just an array of objects that contains the type name and the upgrade function to execute for that type. My initial lookup object can be found in <<EX3-14>>.

[[EX3-14]]
.Type lookup table for the color and number input types
====
[source, js]
----
var typeUpgrades = [
{
  type: 'color',
  upgrade: function(inputs) {
      inputs.kendoColorPicker({ palette: 'basic' });
  }
},
{
  type: 'number',
  upgrade: function(inputs) {
      inputs.kendoNumericTextBox();
  }
}];
----
====

Once I have my lookup table, I can refactor the code in <<EX3-13>> into something more like <<EX3-15>>, where I iterate over each type in my lookup table, test for support and finally, perform the upgrade specified in the +upgrade+ function for each.

[[EX3-15]]
.Using the lookup table to add input type support
====
[source, js]
----
var i, len;
for (i = 0, len = typeUpgrades.length; i < len; i++) {
  var typeObj = typeUpgrades[i];

  if (!isFormTypeSupported(typeObj.type)) {
    var inputs = form.find('input[type=' + typeObj.type + ']');
    typeObj.upgrade(inputs);
  }
}
----
====

If I re-run the sample page in a browser, I'll note that things still work, just as before. That's nice, but the real benefit to refactoring comes when I add additional features to my polyfill, which I'll do next.

Before I move on, it's worth mentioning that refactoring doesn't have to stop with the simple changes I detail above. While it's out of the scope of this short book to belabor the refactoring conversation any further, it's worth mentioning that, in the production version of my polyfill, I did perform some additional refactoring, including breaking my type upgrades and feature tests into two additional files, which I combine during my build process. If you're interested in seeing those additional changes, you can view the https://github.com/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms/blob/master/src/js/kendo.forms.types.js[kendo.ui.form.types.js] and https://github.com/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms/blob/master/src/js/kendo.forms.features.js[kendo.forms.features.js] source files in the https://github.com/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms[online GitHub repo] for my polyfill.

==== Adding Input Types 3-_n_

Now that we've refactored things a bit, let's add support for a third input type: the +range+ type. The http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#range-state-(type=range)[+range+ input type] enables developers to capture numeric data via a slider control with built-in min, max and step values. Here's the text from http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/number-state.html#range-state[section 4.10.7.1.14 in the HTML5 spec]:

.Number State Section of the HTML5 Forms Spec
[quote, W3C HTML Working Group, http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/number-state.html#number-state]
____
*4.10.7.1.14 Range state*

When an input element's type attribute is in the *Range* state, the rules in this section apply.

The input element represents a control for setting the element's value to a string representing a number, but with the caveat that the exact value is not important, letting UAs provide a simpler interface than they do for the Number state.

_Note: In this state, the range and step constraints are enforced even during user input, and there is no way to set the value to the empty string._

If the element is mutable, the user agent should allow the user to change the number represented by its value, as obtained from applying the rules for parsing floating point number values to it. User agents must not allow the user to set the value to a string that is not a valid floating point number. If the user agent provides a user interface for selecting a number, then the value must be set to a best representation of the number representing the user's selection as a floating point number. User agents must not allow the user to set the value to the empty string.

The *value* attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid floating point number.

*The value sanitization algorithm is as follows*: If the value of the element is not a valid floating point number, then set it to a valid floating point number that represents the default value.

The *min* attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid floating point number. The default minimum is 0. The *max* attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a valid floating point number. The default maximum is 100.

The *default value* is the minimum plus half the difference between the minimum and the maximum, unless the maximum is less than the minimum, in which case the default value is the minimum.

When the element is suffering from an *underflow*, the user agent must set the element's value to a valid floating point number that represents the minimum.

When the element is suffering from an *overflow*, if the maximum is not less than the minimum, the user agent must set the element's value to a valid floating point number that represents the maximum.

The *step* scale factor is 1. The default step is 1 (allowing only integers, unless the min attribute has a non-integer value).

When the element is suffering from a step mismatch, the user agent must round the element's value to the nearest number for which the element would not suffer from a step mismatch, and which is greater than or equal to the minimum, and, if the maximum is not less than the minimum, which is less than or equal to the maximum. If two numbers match these constraints, then user agents must use the one nearest to positive infinity.

For example, the markup +<input type="range" min=0 max=100 step=20 value=50>+ results in a range control whose initial value is 60.

*The algorithm to convert a string to a number, given a string input, is as follows*: If applying the rules for parsing floating point number values to input results in an error, then return an error; otherwise, return the resulting number.

*The algorithm to convert a number to a string, given a number input, is as follows*: Return a valid floating point number that represents input.

____

This is much more complex than section for our color and number types, but there's some overlap with the number type, especially around attributes. Let's break this down into some rules, as we've done for the other two:

1. The value attribute of an input with a type of "range" is a floating point number.
2. A valid range value is required at all times. If a valid range is not selected, the default value is used.
3. The range value cannot be set to an empty string.
4. If the user attempts to enter an invalid or non-numeric value, the input value should be set to the default value.
5. The "min" attribute is allowed, and should represent a valid floating point number. The default "min" value is 0.
6. The "max" attribute is allowed, and should represent a valid floating point number. The default "max" value is 100.
7. The *default value* of the range input, if no value is set, is the minimum plus half the difference between the minimum and maximum (+d = min + (max - min)\*.5+). If the default min and max values are used, the default value is 50 (++0 + (100-0)*.5+).
8. When the set value is smaller than the minimum, the value should be automatically set to the minimum.
9. When the set value is larger than the maximum, the value should be automatically set to the maximum.
10. The "step" attribute is allowed and has a default value of 1, which allows only integers to be specified).
11. If the value of the input is set programmatically and that value   violates the specified "step" property (i.e. step is 20 and a value of 50 is set), the control should round the set value up to the closest value that matches the step and which does not violate the max attribute (in this example, the value would be set to 60).

In Kendo UI, the equivalent widget to the range type is the http://demos.kendoui.com/web/slider/index.html[Slider] control, which has identical behavior, and supports all of the necessary attributes and rules specified above. To add support for the range type, I'll add another object literal to my +typeUpgrades+ array, as shown in <<EX3-16>>:

[[EX3-16]]
.Adding support for the range input type 
====
[source, js]
----
{
  type: 'range',
  upgrade: function(inputs) {
    inputs.kendoSlider({
      showButtons: false,
      tickPlacement: 'none'
    });
  }
}
----
====

For the Slider widget, I'll need to pass in a couple of configuration settings so that the default behavior of the Kendo UI Slider matches that of browsers that do support this type. That means no buttons or ticks. Just a simple slider, as depicted in <<EX3-17>>. And the best news is that there is no step two, other than refreshing your browser and viewing the slider in the sample form! With the refactor that we made in the last section, adding support for additional input types is a simple matter of adding a new entry to our lookup table. Now, adding features 3-_n_ is quick and painless.

=== Building Utility Polyfills

When building your polyfill, you might, from time-to-time, encounter a situation where your polyfill needs a polyfill of its own. For instance, there are a bevy of JavaScript utility functions that, while useful, may not be supported in older browsers like IE 6-8, which your polyfill will often need to target. Examples are useful utilities like +String.trim+ and +Array.forEach.+ 

If, when developing your polyfill, you encounter a situation where some utility you need or what isn't supported, you have two choices. You can choose to either leverage some other approach that is supported across browsers, or you can build a polyfill for this utility.

If you choose to take the latter approach, I recommend taking a look at the https://developer.mozilla.org/[Mozilla Developer Network] which, in addition to having the best docs on the web for front-end developers, is also a great resource for quick utility polyfills. For many of their JavaScript docs, MDN provides great information about current browser support, in addition to a quick snippet that can be used to polyfill support for that API across all browsers. An example can be seen in <<EX3-17.5>> below.

This example is a simple polyfill for the +Array.forEach+ method. First, I'll check for the existence of the +forEach+ method on the Array prototype. If the method exists, we do nothing. If not, we'll add our polyfill, which is a simple +for+ loop that iterates over each element of the array. For my HTML5 Forms polyfill, I've included this and other utility polyfills in a standalone source file that is included in my combined and minified production build.

=== Polyfilling visual features with CSS

With the input type refactor done, adding support for most of the remaining types (datetime, date, time, month, etc.) is pretty straightforward and not really worth covering in this book. There are a few quirks here and there with some of the date/time types, especially when it comes to the proper way to format date attribute values, but as long as you ensure you're http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#valid-global-date-and-time-string[properly handling date and time strings as covered in the spec], you should be fine. Your author failed to do so when he first started building his HTML5 Forms polyfill, so do take my word for it. Not coincidentally, it was this experience that lead yours truly to make "Read the Spec" the first principle of responsible polyfill development, as covered in <<polyfills_chapter_2>>.

Rather than covering the rest of the HTML5 input types explicitly, let's turn our focus to a different part of the HTML5 forms spec, and take a look at a scenario where adding polyfill support requires JavaScript and CSS to get the job done. While there are a few areas of the HTML5 spec that require us to delve into CSS, the +placeholder+ attribute is probably the best example of this type of feature. According to http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-placeholder-attribute[the placeholder section of spec], this attribute "represents a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry when the control has no value." In contrast to the +<label>+ element, the placeholder attribute is intended to contain hint text that is overlaid on or displayed inside of input controls, and which disappears when a user enters a value.

Since the spec is pretty straightforward about this attribute, it enjoys pretty broad browser support. However, IE8 and previous don't support this attribute, and most of us still support these browsers in our sites and apps, so it makes sense to polyfill this feature in our library.

To do so, I'm going to start by adding a new css file in my project, under the +src/css/+ directory, and I'll call it +kendo.forms.css+. Then, I'll add the css in <<EX3-18>>

[[EX3-18]]
.CSS for polyfilling placeholder support
====
[source, css]
----
label.placeholder {
    color: gray;
    display: block;
    font-size: small;
    padding-top: 3px;
    position: relative;
    text-indent: 5px;
}

input.placeholder {
    background-color: transparent;
    left: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    z-index: 1;
}

input.relPlaceholder {
    position: relative;
}

input.placeholder:focus, input.placeholder:first-line {
    background-color: white;
}

span.hidden {
    opacity: 0;
}
----
====

My strategy for polyfilling the +placeholder+ will be to create a +<label>+ that contains the same text as the placeholder attribute. The label will be overlaid on top of the input when the element is empty and does not have focus, and will be hidden when the it does. The CSS above is adding a few classes and pseudo elements that I'll need in order to manipulate elements that my polyfill will be creating at runtime. The +label.placeholder+ selector applies to an element that I'll create to hold placeholder text, while the +input.placeholder+ selector applies to the original input for which I'm polyfilling attribute support. The remaining selectors cover positioning and visibility for elements and content.

With our CSS in place, I'll add the JavaScript needed for placeholder support. First, I'll need to add a feature test for this attribute in order to make sure that I don't do any unnecessary work (which will include some DOM interaction) if the browser already supports it. Since I know that this won't be the only attribute my polyfill will need to test for--it will also need to support new attributes like +required+, +pattern+, and more--I'll go ahead and great a generic test function, just like I did for the input types:

====
[source, js]
----
function isAttributeSupported(attr) {
  return attr in document.createElement('input') &&
         attr in document.createElement('textarea');
}
----
====

In the case of HTML5 attributes, testing for support is a simple matter of creating a new in-memory input (and textarea), and checking for the presence of an attribute via JavaScript's +in+ property operator. If the attribute is available on both input types, our test will return true, otherwise, false. Now, we can leverage our test and, if not supported, add in some logic to activate placeholder support, as shown in <<EX3-19>>.

[[EX3-19]]
.Polyfilling placeholder support with CSS and JavaScript
====
[source, js]
----
if(!isAttributeSupported('placeholder')) {
  form.find('[placeholder]').each(function(index, val) {
    var el = $(val);
    // Strip CR and LF from attribute vales, as specified in
    // www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-placeholder-attribute
    var placeholderText = el.attr('placeholder').replace(/(\\r\\n|\\n|\\r)/gm,'');

    // When the field loses focus, clear out the placeholder if
    // the input contains a value.
    el.on('blur', function() {
      var $el = $(this);
      var labelNode = this.previousSibling;
      if (this.value) {
        labelNode.nodeValue = '';
        $el.addClass('relPlaceholder');
      } else if (labelNode.nodeValue !== placeholderText) {
        labelNode.nodeValue = placeholderText;
        $el.removeClass('relPlaceholder');
      }
    });
    el.wrap('<label class="placeholder">' + placeholderText + '</label>');
    el.addClass('placeholder');
  });
}
----
====

Let's walk through this sample step-by-step and take a look at what's going on. First, I'm grabbing all of the inputs with a +placeholder+ attribute from my form. The rest of this block contains the callback for each placeholder-containing element. I start by caching the jQuery object for the element, then grab the placeholder value. The RegEx on that line serves to strip out any newlines that might sneak into the placeholder attribute. This requirement is http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-placeholder-attribute[explicitly covered in the spec] and since we're polyfilling to the spec, it's a no-brainer to add this support.

Once I have a sanitized attribute value, I'll bind my element to a blur event, wrap my element in a new +<label>+ that contains the placeholder text, and then add the "placeholder" class to that label and the original element, which applies the CSS I defined in <<EX3-18>>. The CSS rules give my label some contrast, so that it's obvious to the user that this is not input text (again, as per the spec) while also adding a rule to slide the label over to sit on top of my input.

The final piece of the puzzle is my +blur+ event, which clears out the dummy placeholder label if the user has entered text in the input. Without this event, my placeholder text would show up over any text the user enters after he or she navigates off of the element.

Of course, this is all fine in theory, but as with every other feature we've had so far, it doesn't mean a thing until we test this new feature in a non-supporting browser. However, since +placeholder+ support is so darn good, it's not as simple as testing in one of the new browsers installed on your machine. Often, testing out polyfill support means getting your hands on IE 6, 7 or 8, and we'll discuss how to do that in the next section. 

At this point, you might be wondering why we're switching gears to testing when we've not yet built our entire polyfill. We could go through the exercise of building the entire HTML5 Forms polyfill, but it's a mostly repetitive task now that we've covered the basics of input type support. There are other complexities to be solved, like forms validation, but in the interest of time and space in this short book, I decided to spend some time focusing on unit testing, performance and refactoring over the next few chapters. These aspects of polyfill development are just as important about how you go about building the features themselves. That said, if you want to dig deeper into the guts of the HTML5 Forms polyfill we've started in this chapter, you're welcome to do so in the https://github.com/kendo-labs/kendo-ui-forms[online repository].

=== Testing out your work across browsers

Thus far, we've been "testing" out our polyfill by viewing the sample HTML form in modern browsers like Chome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and IE9+. If you're following along, you've probably even been testing using just a single browser, which tends to be my own manual testing workflow, as well. And while this strategy is fine when you're getting up and running and just trying to get things to work, eventually you're going to need to test in more than one browser. In fact, you're going to need to test in all of them, and often. In <<polyfills_chapter_4>>, I'll discuss some strategies for automating your cross-browser testing, but let's first look at a few ways that you can get started with cross-browser testing.

==== Installing the "Evergreen" Browsers

First, I recommend that you install every single browser that you can get your hands on for your OS. This might seem obvious, but it can't be overstated. When building cross-browser polyfills, you're venturing into the weeds so that other developers don't have to, so you'd better have access to every browser you can. 

And I don't just mean the consumer release of every browser, but also the betas, dev channel, nightly releases and platform previews of all of these. You not only need to know what you're polyfill needs to support today, but tomorrow as well. Sometimes, browser updates will modify their support for a feature in ways that will actually break your polyfill (spec API changes and vendor prefixes are two examples), and you'll want to be covered. 

Modern, self-updating browsers are commonly referred to as "Evergreen," because they're always considered new and up-to-date. Nearly every major browser vendor now supports a self-updating model, and <<EX3-20>> lists out all of these browsers, where to find them, as well as pre-release versions of these.

[NOTE]
====
While many of the names above are pretty straightforward, "Chrome Canary" isn't very self-explanatory. Canary is Google's "nightly" browser, which is updated once per day and represents the most cutting-edge work being done to Google Chrome.

==== Testing in oldIE

In addition to testing out your polyfill in the latest version of all of the browsers above--not to mention mobile browsers if you're supporting those--I highly recommend hands-on testing with Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8. If you're a Windows user, you might be tempted to use the "Browser Mode" and "Document Mode" features in IE's F12 Developer Tools to simulate IE 7 and 8. I humbly ask that you resist that temptation but for the simplest of tests. These modes do a decent job of _simulating_ the behaviors of oldIE, sure, but they aren't foolproof. For example, <<EX3-21>> and <<EX3-22>> illustrate the differences I see when running my HTML5 Forms polyfill test suite (which I'll introduce in the next chapter) in IE 11, with simulation, and in IE 8. It's the same code and same test suite for both, and even though Document Mode is providing me an IE 8 experience, in theory, in practice you'll find that this is not always the case.

Thankfully, testing oldIE doesn't require that you buy old Windows Vista and XP licenses and install these browsers on the old hardware sitting in your closet. On the contrary, Microsoft hosts a fantastic site called http://modern.ie[modern.ie] that's purpose built around the idea of providing developers with all the tools they need to support and test the various Internet Explorer browsers. In addition to providing tools like a page scanning service and documentation on standards support for newer versions of the browser, the site provides free virtual machines for testing all versions of IE, including 6, 7 and 8. Whether you use VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels, Virtual PC or Hyper-V, there are free VMs available for you to download, fire-up and use to test out your hard work. To grab a VM, just head over to http://modern.ie[modern.ie] and click the "Test Across Browsers" menu option.

==== Cross-Browser Testing and Verification with Online Services

In addition to testing with your own browsers, and testing oldIE with VMs, there are a growing number of online services available that you can use to easily test your work across browsers without installing another browser or running a VM. One popular service is http://www.browserstack.com/[BrowserStack] which allows you to test public and internal urls across a variety of OSes and browsers, from within a browser window. You can also automate BrowserStack tests via Selenium for automated testing. The only catch with BrowserStack is that the service is not free, so it's not likely to be an option for most open-source cross-browser polyfills.

Another great option for cross-browser testing is http://ci.testling.com/[Testling], a CI server that tests your code across browsers each time you push to your remote repo. Testling requires some form of automated unit test suite, but I consider this to be a plus because automated testing across the 18 versions Testling supports is far more ideal than manual tests, in my opinion. We'll discuss setting up unit and cross-browser tests in the next chapter.

In this chapter, we covered the basics of getting your polyfill project setup, and we also added basic features, did a simple refactor to improve polyfill maintenance, and we even added support for the +placeholder+ forms attribute in oldIE. We've come a long way already, and I hope you've learned a thing or two about putting those principles of responsible polyfill development into practice.

As great as our progress has been so far, though, you might find yourself bothered by the fact that a) our polyfill isn't terribly easy to test and b) we don't really have a strategy in place for linting our code, performing minification, or doing anything else that a good project should do before releasing "production quality" code. In <<polyfills_chapter_4>>, we're going to cover all of these, and more.
